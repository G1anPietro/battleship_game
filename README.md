it's a simple site, i don't have much to say.
i created this repository so i can have this project all the time with me.

hope it helps.

some names are in italian, like the names of the images and some alt and classes.

there are 2 versions:
1 without AI: you have some ammunition and try to find all the subs.
2 with AI: you try to battle with an AI to who finds all the subs first.

no use of ChatGpt was involved in the creation of this project.
